# my data viewer

using wxwidgets-test1 project as a template, create a new project using the same technologies and layout called "my-data-viewer"

This project will allow users to create datasources/connections to known databases such as postgres or mysql. On each it will list the tables, columns, indexes and data table, and even create and execute sql scripts over them

It will use sqlite to store all this data in current's user $HOME/.my-data-viewer folder. Will allow to change schema by adding .sql migration files. For each concept there will be a ConceptRepository class which access db using pure sql

For now implement the concept of "datasource" with the following fields:


 * id int PK
 * name text not null
 * type (postgres, mysql, csv) text not null
 * file_path text default null
 * db_host text default null
 * db_port int default null
 * db_name text default null
 * db_user text default null
 * db_password text default null

create a datasourceRepository which allows to 
 * create a new datasource
 * list datasource, filtering by name contains and type
 * delete datasource
 * update datasource


The datasourceRepository will also allow to execute operations: 
 * list all tables
 * for each table list all of its fields (columns), field types, indexes
 * being able to execute sql against it.



In the UI, add a "datasources" screen which allows to CRUD datasource. 

For now, let's just implement the connection type "csv" for which file_path is required which is the path to a csv file
in csv datasources, implement the following operations with this behavior:
 * list all tables : just list one table wich is the csv file name
 * for each table list all of its fields (columns), field types, indexes: just list the csv columns names with "text" type
 * being able to execute sql against it. Use duckdb to load the csv


ANSWER:

table, and even create and execute sql scripts over them.

It will use sqlite to store all this data in current user's $HOME/.my-data-viewer
folder. Will allow to change schema by adding .sql migration files. For each concept
there will be a ConceptRepository class which accesses the db using pure sql.

For now implement the concept of "datasource" with the following fields: id, name,
type (postgres, mysql, csv), file_path, db_host, db_port, db_name, db_user,
db_password.

Create a DatasourceRepository which allows to create/list (filter by name-contains
and type)/delete/update a datasource, and to execute operations against it: list all
tables, for each table list its fields/types/indexes, and execute arbitrary sql.

In the UI, add a "Datasources" screen which allows to CRUD datasources.

For now, only the "csv" connection type is implemented: file_path is required, and
its operations behave as: list all tables -> just the csv file name; list columns
-> the csv column names, all typed "text"; execute sql -> query it via DuckDB.
